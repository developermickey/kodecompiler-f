We understand that circumstances may arise where you may need to request a refund for payments made to our platform. This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions under which refunds may be issued.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We offer refunds for payments made to KodeCompiler under certain circumstances. Refunds may be requested if you experience technical issues that prevent you from accessing our services, if you were charged incorrectly due to billing errors, or if our services do not function as described in our documentation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            To be eligible for a refund, requests must typically be made within 30 days of the original purchase date. Refund requests made after this period may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but approval is not guaranteed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Please note that refunds are not available for services that have been fully utilized, for promotional or discounted purchases (unless required by law), or for violations of our Terms of Service that result in account termination.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            If you believe you are eligible for a refund, please contact our support team as soon as possible. You can reach us by email at support@kodecompiler.com or through our contact form on the website.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            When submitting a refund request, please include your account email address, the transaction ID or payment receipt, the date of purchase, a detailed explanation of why you are requesting a refund, and any relevant screenshots or documentation that supports your request.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Our support team will review your request and respond within 3-5 business days. We may request additional information to process your refund request. Please ensure that all information provided is accurate and complete to avoid delays in processing.

        <section className="mb-10">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Refund Processing</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Once your refund request has been approved, we will process the refund to your original payment method. The time it takes for the refund to appear in your account depends on your payment provider and may take 5-10 business days.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            If you paid by credit card, the refund will be credited back to the same credit card. If you paid through a digital wallet or other payment service, the refund will be returned to that account. In some cases, we may issue refunds via alternative methods if the original payment method is no longer available.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You will receive an email confirmation once your refund has been processed. If you do not receive your refund within the expected timeframe, please contact your payment provider first, as there may be additional processing time on their end. If the issue persists, please contact our support team for assistance.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Subscription Cancellations</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            If you have a subscription plan with KodeCompiler, you may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings. Upon cancellation, you will continue to have access to paid features until the end of your current billing period.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Subscription cancellations do not automatically qualify for refunds. However, if you cancel within the first 7 days of your initial subscription purchase, you may be eligible for a full refund of that billing period. Refunds for subsequent billing periods are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We do not provide prorated refunds for partial subscription periods. If you cancel your subscription mid-cycle, you will not receive a refund for the remaining days of that billing period, but your subscription will remain active until the period ends.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Certain purchases and services are non-refundable under any circumstances. This includes one-time purchases or credits that have been fully consumed or used, custom development services or consulting fees, third-party services or integrations purchased through our platform, and charges resulting from unauthorized use of your account due to your failure to protect your login credentials.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Additionally, refunds will not be issued for any fees or charges incurred as a result of your violation of our Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policy. We reserve the right to deny refund requests that we determine to be fraudulent or abusive.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Billing Errors</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            If you believe you have been charged incorrectly or have identified a billing error, please contact us immediately. We will investigate the issue and, if an error is confirmed, we will issue a full refund of the incorrect charge.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Common billing errors may include duplicate charges, charges for services you did not purchase, or charges that continue after you have cancelled your subscription. We take billing accuracy seriously and will work quickly to resolve any discrepancies.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            If you file a chargeback or payment dispute with your bank or credit card company without first contacting us to resolve the issue, we reserve the right to immediately suspend or terminate your account. Chargebacks may also result in the loss of access to any content, data, or services associated with your account.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We encourage you to contact our support team before initiating a chargeback. In most cases, we can resolve billing issues quickly and amicably without the need for payment disputes. Chargebacks can take weeks to resolve and may result in additional fees from your payment provider.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If you have already initiated a chargeback and wish to resolve the matter directly with us, please contact our support team immediately. We will work with you to address your concerns and may be able to reverse the chargeback process.
